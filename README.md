FitPress is a WordPress plugin that allows fitness facilities who require bookings for classes to have members create a profile on their site, get a certain amount of credits every month, and then book sessions that have been created. Sessions can be based on different types of classes and support many variations in scheduling.

FitPress has the following features:

- Member signup and management
- Package management
